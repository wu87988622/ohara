How to build
============

.. _build-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

-  OpenJDK 1.8
-  Scala 2.12.9
-  Gradle 5.1+
-  Node.js 8.12.0
-  Yarn 1.13.0 or greater
-  Docker 18.09 or greater (Official QA is on docker 18.09. Also, docker
   multi-stage, which is supported by Docker 17.05 or higher, is
   required in building ohara images. see `Use multi-stage builds`_ for more details)
-  Kubernetes 1.14.1 (Official QA uses the Kubernetes version is 1.14.1)

.. _build-gradle-commands:

Gradle Commands
---------------

Ohara build is based on `gradle`_. Ohara has defined many gradle tasks
to simplify the development of ohara.

.. _build-binary:

  Build Binary

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ./gradlew clean build -x test

    .. note::
      the tar file is located at ohara-${module}/build/distributions

  Run All UTs

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ./gradlew clean test

    .. note::

       Ohara IT tests requires specific envs, and all IT tests will be
       skipped if you don't pass the related setting to IT. Ohara recommends
       you testing your code on `official QA`_ which offers the powerful
       machine and IT envs.

    .. tip::

      add flag "-PskipManager" to skip the tests of Ohara Manager. Ohara Manager is a module
      in charge of Ohara UI. Feel free to skip it if you are totally a backend developer. By
      the way, the prerequisites of testing Ohara Manager is shown in :ref:`here <managerdev>`

    .. tip::

      add flag "-PmaxParallelForks=6" to increase the number of test process to start in parallel.
      The default value is number of cores / 2, and noted that too many tests running in parallel may
      easily produce tests timeout.

  Code Style Auto-Apply

    Use this task to make sure your added code will have the same format and conventions with the rest of codebase.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ./gradlew spotlessApply

    .. note::

       we have this style check in early QA build.


  License Auto-Apply

    If you have added any new files in a PR. This task will automatically
    insert an Apache 2.0 license header in each one of these newly created
    files

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ./gradlew licenseApply

    .. note::

       Note that a file without the license header will fail at early QA
       build

  Publish Artifacts to JFrog Bintray

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ./gradlew clean bintrayUpload -PskipManager -PbintrayUser=$user -PbintrayKey=$key

    .. tip::

      - bintrayUser: the account that has write permission to the repository
      - bintrayKey: the account API Key
      - public: whether to auto published after uploading. default is false
      - override: whether to override version artifacts already published. default is false

    .. note::

       Only release manager has permission to upload artifacts

  Publish Artifacts to local maven repository

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -PskipManager -x test

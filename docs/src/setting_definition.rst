Setting Definition Guide
========================

A powerful application always has a complicated configuration. In order to
be a best friend of Ohara users, Ohara provides a method which
can return the details of setting definitions, and ohara suggests that
all developers ought to implement the method so as to guide
users through the complicated settings of your applications.

.. note::
   If you have no interest in settings or your application is too simple
   to have any settings, you can just skip this section.

SettingDef is a class used to describe the details of **a** setting. It consists of following arguments.

#. :ref:`reference <setting-definition-reference>` (**string**) — works for ohara manager. It represents the reference of value.
#. group (**string**) — the group of this setting (all core setting are in core group)
#. orderInGroup (**int**) — the order in group
#. displayName (**string**) — the readable name of this setting
#. permission (**string**) — the way to "touch" value. It consists of

  - READ_ONLY — you can't define an new value for it
  - CREATE_ONLY — you can't update the value to an new one
  - EDITABLE — feel free to modify the value as you wish :)

#. key (**string**) — the key of configuration
#. :ref:`valueType <setting-definition-type>` (**string**) — the type of value
#. necessary (**string**)

  - REQUIRED — this field has no default and user MUST define something for it.
  - OPTIONAL — this field has no default and user does NOT need to define something for it.
  - RANDOM_DEFAULT — this field has a "random" default value

#. defaultValue (**object**) — the default value. the type is equal to what valueType defines
                               but we only allow string, number and boolean type to have default value currently.
#. documentation (**string**) — the explanation of this definition
#. internal (**boolean**) — true if this setting is assigned by system automatically.
#. tableKeys (**array(object)**) — the description to Type.TABLE

  - tableKeys[i].name - the column name
  - tableKeys[i].type - acceptable type (string, number and boolean)
  - tableKeys[i].recommendedValues - recommended values (it is legal to enter other values you prefer)

.. note::
   You can call :ref:`Worker APIs <rest-workers>` to get all connectors’ setting definitions, and use
   :ref:`Stream APIs <rest-stream>` to get all stream setting definitions.

Although a SettingDef can include many elements, you can simply
build a SettingDef with only what you need. An extreme example is
that you can create a SettingDef with only key.

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).build();

Notwithstanding it is flexible to build a SettingDef, we
encourage developers to create a description-rich
SettingDef. More description to your setting produces more
**document** in calling ohara rest APIs. We
all hate write documentation so it would be better to make your code
readable.


Reference, Internal and TableKeys Are NOT Public
------------------------------------------------

Ohara offers a great UI, which is located at ohara-manager. The UI
requires some **private** information to generate forms for custom
applications. The such private information is specific-purpose and is
meaningless to non-ohara developers. Hence, all of them are declared as
package-private and ohara does not encourage developers
to stop at nothing to use them.


Optional, Required And Default Value
------------------------------------

We know a great application must have countless settings and only The
Chosen One can control it. In order to shorten the gap between your
application and human begin, ohara encourage developers
to offer the default values to most of settings as much as possible.
Assigning a default value to a SettingDef is a piece of cake.

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).optional(defaultValue).build();

.. note::
   the default value is declared as **string** type as it must be **readable** in Restful APIs.

After calling the **optional(String)** method, the response, created by
:ref:`Worker APIs <rest-workers>` for example, will display
the following information.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "necessary": "OPTIONAL_WITH_DEFAULT",
     "defaultValue": "ur_default_value"
   }

.. note::
   The default value will be added to :ref:`TaskSetting <connector-source-start>` automatically if the specified
   key is not already associated with a value.

A Readonly Setting Definition
-----------------------------

You can declare a **readonly** setting that not only exposes something
of your application to user but also remind user the setting can’t be
changed at runtime. For instance, the information of
:ref:`version <connector-version>` is fixed after you have completed your connector
so it is not an **editable** setting. Hence, ohara define a setting for
**version** with a readonly label. By the way, you should assign a
default value to a readonly setting since a readonly setting without
default value is really weird. There is a example of creating a readonly
setting.

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder()
    .key(key)
    .optional(defaultValue)
    .permission(SettingDef.Permission.READ_ONLY)
    .build();

.. note::
   The input value will be removed automatically if the associated setting is declared readonly.

.. _setting-definition-reference:

Setting Reference
-----------------

This element is a specific purpose. It is used by Ohara manager (UI)
only. If you don’t have interest in UI, you can just ignore this
element. However, we still list the available values here.

#. TOPIC
#. FILE
#. ZOOKEEPER
#. BROKER
#. WORKER

.. note::
   For each reference value, it may has different type and will produce different behavior.

Topic String
   .. code-block:: java

      SettingDef.builder().key("topic").reference(Reference.TOPIC).required(Type.STRING).build();

   which means the request should "accept one topic of string type"

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "topic": "t1"
      }

----------------------------

TopicKey List
   .. code-block:: java

      SettingDef.builder().key("topicKeys").reference(Reference.TOPIC).required(Type.OBJECT_KEYS).build();

   which means the request should "accept topic list of **TopicKey** type"

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "topicKeys": [
          {
            "group": "default",
            "name": "t1"
          },
          {
            "group": "default",
            "name": "t2"
          }
        ]
      }

----------------------------

Topic String List
   .. code-block:: java

      SettingDef.builder().key("topics").reference(Reference.TOPIC).required(Type.ARRAY).build();

   which means the request should "accept topic list of string type"

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "topics": ["t1", "t2", "t3"]
      }

.. _setting-definition-type:

Value Type
----------

In a custom application, the settings could have various data type. In order to display correct data type in
ohara manager and leverage the benefit of :ref:`type checker<checker>`, we strongly suggest you to define the
correct data type for each setting.

The following data types are supported currently.

Type.BOOLEAN
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Boolean type represents that the data should have only two possible value: **true** or **false**.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Boolean**

Type.STRING
^^^^^^^^^^^

String type represents that the data should be a string.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.String**

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.STRING).build();

Type.POSITIVE_SHORT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Short type represents that the data should be a 2-bytes integer.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Short**. Noted: only positive number is acceptable

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.POSITIVE_SHORT).build();

Type.SHORT
^^^^^^^^^^

Short type represents that the data should be a 2-bytes integer.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Short**

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.SHORT).build();

Type.POSITIVE_INT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Int type represents that the data should be a 4-bytes integer.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Integer**. Noted: only positive number is acceptable

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.POSITIVE_INT).build();

Type.INT
^^^^^^^^

Int type represents that the data should be a 4-bytes integer.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Integer**

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.INT).build();

Type.POSITIVE_LONG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Long type represents that the data should be a 8-bytes integer.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Long**. Noted: only positive number is acceptable

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.POSITIVE_LONG).build();

Type.LONG
^^^^^^^^^

Long type represents that the data should be a 8-bytes integer.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Long**

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.LONG).build();

Type.POSITIVE_DOUBLE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Double type represents that the data should be a 8-bytes floating point.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Double**. Noted: only positive number is acceptable

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.POSITIVE_DOUBLE).build();

Type.DOUBLE
^^^^^^^^^^^

Double type represents that the data should be a 8-bytes floating point.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.Double**

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.DOUBLE).build();

Type.ARRAY
^^^^^^^^^^

Array type represents that the data should be a collection of data.
We don't check the element data type in the collection, that is, the following request is legal in
SettingDef but will produce a weird behavior in ohara manager. We suggest you use the same data type of element
in array.


.. code-block:: json

   {
     "key": ["abc", 123, 2.0]
   }

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.ARRAY).build();

.. note::
   An empty array is ok and will pass the checker:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "key": []
      }

.. note::
  the default value to array value is empty

Type.CLASS
^^^^^^^^^^

Class type represents that the data is a class. This data type is used to display a value that is a class.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.String**.

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.CLASS).build();

Type.PASSWORD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Password type represents that the data is a password. We will replace the value by **hidden** symbol in APIs.
if the data type is used as password.
The value must be able cast to **java.lang.String**.

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).required(Type.PASSWORD).build();


Type.JDBC_TABLE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JDBC_TABLE is a specific string type used to reminder Ohara Manager that
this field requires a **magic** button to show available tables of
remote database via Query APIs. Except for the **magic** in UI, there is
no other stuff for this JDBC_TYPE since kafka can’t verify the input
arguments according to other arguments. It means we can’t connect to
remote database to check the existence of input table.

It is ok to replace this field by Type.STRING if you don’t use Ohara
Manager. Nevertheless, we still encourage developer to choose
the **fitting** type for your setting if you demand your user to input a
database table.

Type.TABLE
^^^^^^^^^^

Table type enable you to define a setting having table structure value.
Apart from assigning Type.Table to your setting definition, you also
have to define which keys are in your table. The following example show
a case that declares a table having two columns called **c0** and **c1**.

.. code-block:: java

   SettingDef.builder().key(key).tableKeys(Arrays.asList("c0", "c1")).required(Type.TABLE).build();

The legal value for above setting definition is shown below.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "key": [
       {
         "c0": "v0",
         "c1": "v1"
       },
       {
         "c0": "v2",
         "c1": "v3"
       }
     ]
   }

The above example implies there is a table having two columns called
**c0** and **c1**. Also, you assign two values to **c0** that first is
**v0** and another is **v2**. Ohara offers a check for Type.Table that
the input value **must** match all keys in.

How to get the description of above **keys** ? If the setting type is
**table**, the setting must have **tableKeys**. It is a array of string
which shows the keys used in the table type. For instance, a setting
having table type is shown below.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "reference": "NONE",
     "displayName": "columns",
     "internal": false,
     "documentation": "output schema",
     "valueType": "TABLE",
     "tableKeys": [
       "order",
       "dataType",
       "name",
       "newName"
     ],
     "orderInGroup": 6,
     "key": "columns",
     "necessary": "REQUIRED",
     "defaultValue": null,
     "group": "core",
     "permission": "EDITABLE"
   }

.. note::
   If you ignore the table keys for Type.Table, the check to your input
   value is also ignored. By contrast, the table keys are useless for
   other types.

.. note::
  the default value to table value is empty

Type.DURATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time-based amount of time is a common setting in our world. However,
it is also hard to reach the consensus about the **string representation**
for a duration. For instance, the java.time.Duration
prefers ISO-8601, such as PT10S. The scala.concurrent.duration.Duration
prefers simple format, such as 10 seconds. Ohara offers a official
support to Duration type so as to ease the pain of using string in
connector. When you declare a setting with duration type, ohara provides
the default check which casts input value to java Duration and scala
Duration. Also, your connector can get the **Duration** from
:ref:`TaskSetting <connector-source-start>` easily without worrying about the
conversion between java and scala. Furthermore, connector users can
input both java.Duration and scala.Duration when starting connector.

The value must be castable to **java.time.Duration** and it is based on the ISO-860 duration
format PnDTnHnMn.nS

Type.REMOTE_PORT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remote port is a common property to connector. For example, the ftp connector
needs port used to connect to source/target ftp server in remote . Inputting a
illegal port can destroy connector easily. Declaring your type of value
to Port involve a check that only the port which is small than 65536 and
bigger than zero can be accepted. Other port value will be rejected in
starting connector.

Type.BINDING_PORT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is similar to Type.PORT except that the value mapped to BINDING_PORT has a extra check to the availability on
the target nodes. For example, you define value 5555 as a BINDING_PORT, and you will get a exception when you try to
deploy your code on the node which is using port 5555 as well. The legal value of binding port is between [0, 65535].

Type.OBJECT_KEY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

object key represents a format of **oharastream.ohara.common.setting.ObjectKey** for specific object.
It consists "group" and "name" fields.
In a custom application, you should check the request contains both fields.

.. code-block::json

   {
     "key": {
       "group": "default",
       "name": "abc"
     }
   }

Type.OBJECT_KEYS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OBJECT_KEYS represents a list of **oharastream.ohara.common.setting.Obj**.
Note the type of the plural char "s". It means the request value should pass a array.

.. code-block::json

   {
     "objectKeys": [{
       "group": "default",
       "name": "t1"
     }]
   }

.. note::
  the default value to object keys value is empty

Type.TAGS
^^^^^^^^^

Tags is a flexible type that accept a json object. It could uses in some circumstances that user needs to define
additional values which type is not list above.

.. code-block::json

   {
     "tags": {
       "name": "hello",
       "anArray": ["bar", "foo"],
       "count": 10,
       "params": {
         "k": "v"
       }
     }
   }

.. note::
  the default value to tags value is empty

Necessary
---------

In Ohara world, most components have a lot of configs to offers various usage in production. In order to simplify the settings,
most configs have default value and you can trace Necessary field to know that.

Necessary field has four values.

#. REQUIRED — this value has no default value and it must be defined. You may get error if you don't give any value to it.
#. OPTIONAL — this value has no default value but it is ok to leave nothing.
#. RANDOM_DEFAULT — the default value assigned to this value is random. For example, all objects' name has
                                  a random string by default; The binding port field has a random free port by default.


.. _checker:

Checker
-------

We all love quick failure, right? A quick failure can save our resource
and time. Ohara offers many checks for your setting according to the
**expected** type. For example, a setting declared **Duration** type has
a checker which validate whether the input value is able to be cast to
either java.time.Duration or scala.duration.Duration. However, you are
going to design a complicated connector which has specific limit for
input value.

.. _denylist:

DenyList
---------

The denyList is a useful information that it offers following checks.

1. The restful APIs will reject the values in the denyList
1. Ohara UI disable user to input the illegal words

Currently, denyList is used by Array type only.

.. _recommendedValues:

Recommended values
------------------

Recommended values is used by Ohara UI that it able to pop a list to users when they are using UI.

Currently, recommended values is used by String type only.
